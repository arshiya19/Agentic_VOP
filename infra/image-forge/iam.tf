#   2. Push/pull to the ONE test ECR repository (scoped by ARN) + the

#
# Deliberately NO signing-key access on this role. For the v1 slice keyless
# signing is intended to run off-box (GitHub Actions OIDC) so the build host
# never holds signing material — a step toward the L3 "signing secret not
# accessible to build steps" requirement. If signing is later moved on-box
# with KMS, add a tightly-scoped kms:Sign statement here and revisit the L3
# gap analysis.

# =============================================================================
# CI SIGNING ROLE (GitHub Actions OIDC, main branch only)
# =============================================================================
# Option A keyless-signing identity. GitHub Actions assumes this role to:
#   1. Pull the already-built image FROM the test ECR repo BY DIGEST
#      (the build box pushes the unsigned image; CI signs that exact digest).
#   2. Attach cosign signatures + SBOM + SLSA provenance attestations, which
#      cosign stores as additional OCI artifacts IN THE SAME repo (the
#      sha256-<digest>.sig / .att tags) — so the identity needs repo WRITE
#      even though it never "builds" anything.
#
# Why this role lives in the module (not the central infra/iam.tf): it is
# workload-scoped — its sole purpose is to act on THIS module's ECR repo, and
# its permissions are meaningless without that repo. This mirrors the existing
# app-hosting module, which likewise keeps its workload-scoped CI role
# (app_deploy) in infra/app-hosting/iam.tf rather than the central file.
#
# Keyless signing note: the signing KEY is never stored here. Fulcio issues a
# short-lived cert bound to this role's GitHub OIDC identity at sign time.
# This role grants only ECR access, not any kms:Sign — which is what keeps the
# signing material off the build host and advances the SLSA L3 "signing secret
# not accessible to build steps" requirement.
#
# Repo migration: the trust is built from var.github_repository. When the repo
# moves to a new owner, change that one variable + re-apply; verifiers must
# then expect the new --certificate-identity (documented in the signing design).
