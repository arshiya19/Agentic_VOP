    ─── Design: why LLM-facing sub-schemas use extra="ignore" ───
    Every sub-schema below (RemediationStep, ValidationTest, TestScript,
    RollbackPlan, RemediationPathway, LLMRemediationOutput itself) uses
    extra="ignore" instead of extra="forbid".

    Reason: LLMs periodically emit fields the schema doesn't declare —
    the wrong-shape drift is unavoidable at scale. With extra="forbid",
    any single unexpected field hard-fails the entire package parse and
    the pipeline falls back to the hybrid CLI-only planner (bad). With
    extra="ignore", the offending field is silently dropped and the rest
    of the (well-formed) package parses cleanly.

    Required fields still enforced — if the LLM drops something we
    actually need, the parse still fails visibly. But it fails on missing
    REQUIRED data, not on gratuitous extras. Genuine data errors surface;
    LLM whims don't.

    This is deliberately more permissive than the pattern for
    LLMNormalizedIssue / LLMEnrichmentDecision (which stay extra="forbid"

    strict-mode drift is rare and revealing).
