"""Master — DEMO orchestrator.

LangGraph shape:
  START → load_context → sample → enrich → remediate → fix → summarize → END

The demo pipeline seeds `demo.issues` by SAMPLING 1 issue per family from
real -ec2 issues in `public.issues` (see sample_from_real.py). Enrichment,
remediation (SA3), and execution (SA4) then run against those copied rows,
isolated in demo schema.

Differences vs real master.py:
  - No planning step — fixed sequence, no LLM plan needed.
  - No FETCH step — real fetch already ran and populated public.issues with
    -ec2 sources; the demo just samples from those.
  - Adds a REMEDIATE step (via planner_demo) after enrichment.
  - Adds a FIX step (Sub-Agent 4) after remediation — auto-chained per
    settings.fixer_auto_chain. Runs against env2 via SSM RunCommand.
  - All state reads/writes go through demo.* (via supabase_admin_demo()).

Run entry: run_demo_master(run_id) — mirrors run_master().
