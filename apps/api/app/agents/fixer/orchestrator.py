"""Sub-Agent 4 orchestrator — top-level, family-blind.

Loads a remediation_package, picks the right BaseFixStrategy subclass,
runs the 5-phase lifecycle (pre_flight → backup → execute → validate →
rollback-on-failure), and persists the outcome to fix_runs.

Zero strategy-specific logic here. Adding a new family later = new
BaseFixStrategy subclass + one line in the `_STRATEGY_BY_KEY` dispatch
map at the top of this file. Everything else stays untouched.

Two entry points:
  run_fixer(package_id, ...)      — used by API endpoint + auto-chain
  run_fixer_demo(package_id, ...) — same flow but on demo schema

# ─── Process-level env2 dispatch lock ────────────────────────────────────
# The DB-based `any_concurrent_run` check has a TOCTOU race: multiple
# background dispatches (typical when a user approves several HITL packages
# in quick succession) all wake up simultaneously when a prior fix finishes,
# each pass the "is env2 busy?" SELECT, and each rush to INSERT a new
# fix_run — putting two SA-4 runs in parallel on env2 despite the design
# saying "one at a time." Result: both hit env2 contention, both trivy
# rescans time out, both roll back.
#
# A process-local `threading.Lock` closes the window inside a single
# uvicorn worker. Combined with the existing DB check (which stays as
# cross-process backup), dispatches strictly serialize.
#
# Multi-worker deploys need a real DB lease (postgres advisory lock or
# a leases table). Not required for the current single-process backend.

    #     If it passes, the vulnerability is objectively closed. Ancillary
    #     CLI checks (aws s3api get-*, describe-*) are supplementary — useful
    #     for the trace but they can fail for reasons unrelated to whether
    #     the fix worked (unset shell var, missing IAM permission, output
    #     format shift). Rolling back a confirmed fix because of a supplementary
    #     check failure defeats the whole point of the closed loop.
    #   - Absent a scanner re-scan (SA3 v2.4 hard rule 17 violation), fall
    #     back to strict mode: any non-rescan failure triggers rollback.
