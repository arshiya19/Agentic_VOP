"""Sub-Agent 4 pre-flight package rewriter.

Sits between pre_flight_check() and backup() in the SA4 lifecycle. Snapshots
env2's actual state (IAM identity, terraform resources, target-resource state)
then asks an LLM to review the package and rewrite any steps that will fail
given the observed reality.

The classic scenario this catches (surfaced by Nikhil's Kiro analysis, 2026-07-15):
SA3 emits `sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"` for S3 encryption, which is technically
the more secure choice — but env2's IAM role has no `kms:CreateKey` permission,
so `terraform apply` fails at runtime. Pre-flight sees the IAM policy list,
notices no KMS access, and rewrites the step to `sse_algorithm = "AES256"`
(zero permissions needed). SA4 then executes the rewritten package and
Checkov's re-scan passes.

Design principles:
  * FAIL-OPEN. If snapshot or LLM errors, execute the ORIGINAL package.
    Rewriter failures MUST NOT block fixes — this is a review layer, not a
    critical path.
  * MODIFY ONLY. The rewriter can update remediation_steps in place but
    cannot add, delete, or reorder them. Preserves the audit trail (package
    still has N steps, each with its rewrite reason stored inline).
  * HIGH CONFIDENCE ONLY. LLM emits confidence per rewrite; only 'high'
    rewrites are applied. Medium/low are logged as advisory so operators can
    review them but don't affect execution.
  * SAFETY LAYER. Every rewrite still passes through validate_command();
    any rewrite that fails safety is dropped, original step preserved.
  * TRUTHFUL TRACE. Every applied rewrite gets a MESSAGE line with
    (step_index, reason, first 200 chars of before). Unfixable concerns
    become WARNING lines so operators know the demo's honest limits.

# ============================================================================
# LLM prompt
# ============================================================================
_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the pre-flight reviewer for Sub-Agent 4 (the Fixer).

You review remediation packages BEFORE they execute against real infrastructure.
Your job: catch steps that will fail given what we know about the target
environment, and rewrite them to shapes that will actually work.

You have three signals to work from:
  1. The finding being remediated
  2. The full remediation package (remediation_steps + their commands)
  3. An env-state snapshot: IAM identity + attached policies, terraform state
     resources, and current state of the target resource

Emit exactly one tool call to `PreflightRewritePlan`. Do not emit prose.

RULES for `rewrites`:
  * You can ONLY modify existing steps. You cannot add, delete, or reorder
    steps. This preserves the audit trail — the package still has N steps,
    each carrying its rewrite reason.
  * Only mark `confidence = "high"` when you have CONCRETE EVIDENCE from
    the snapshot. Speculation is "medium", guessing is "low".
  * The `new_step` MUST preserve the same shape as the original — same
    Action + Command: + Why: sections. Only change what needs changing.
  * HCL edits MUST stay in `cat >> file << 'EOF' ... EOF` heredoc form.
    Never emit bare HCL as Command block content.
  * Cite the SPECIFIC snapshot evidence in your `reason` field.

TWO HIGH-VALUE PATTERNS to always check for (both are HIGH-CONFIDENCE if
snapshot evidence is present):

  Pattern 1 — KMS lockdown (fires on CKV_AWS_145 and similar):
    IF `capabilities.kms_list` starts with "DENIED"
    AND any step contains `sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"` or references a KMS
        key / kms:CreateKey / kms:GenerateDataKey / `--kms-key-id`
    THEN rewrite the step to use `sse_algorithm = "AES256"` (needs zero
    permissions) and drop any KMS-key-discovery preludes. Cite the DENIED
    kms_list probe in your reason.

  Pattern 2 — Duplicate resource (fires when a prior fix already added the
                                  same resource):
    IF `terraform_resources` already contains the HCL address the step is
        trying to add (e.g. step does `cat >> main.tf << EOF resource
        "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "vulnerable_bucket" {...} EOF`
        AND the resources list already has
        `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.vulnerable_bucket`)
    THEN rewrite to a no-op step in the FULL PROPER SHAPE (never bare echo).
    The `new_step` must still contain Action + Command: + Why: sections so
    the executor's parser accepts it. Correct no-op shape:

        Skip — resource already present in terraform state.

        Command:
            echo "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.vulnerable_bucket already in state — nothing to add"

        Why: Terraform state already contains
        aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.vulnerable_bucket. Adding it again
        would fail with 'Duplicate resource'; the desired end-state is
        already declared, so this step is a no-op.

    Alternatively, add to `unfixable_concerns` if you can't determine a safe
    rewrite. Do NOT let a duplicate-resource step reach terraform plan — it
    hard-fails and rolls back the entire fix.

Do not invent rewrites when the package looks correct. Emit
`rewrites=[]` — that IS the right answer when the snapshot doesn't reveal a
problem.

RULES for `unfixable_concerns`:
  * Use for issues you SPOT but cannot fix by rewriting a single step.
  * Do NOT put general commentary here. Only concrete blockers with
    specific evidence.

If the package looks correct given the snapshot: emit rewrites=[] and
unfixable_concerns=[]. That is a valid, encouraged answer. Do not invent
rewrites to justify running.
