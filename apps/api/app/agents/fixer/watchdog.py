"""Watchdog + reaper for fix_runs.

Guarantees every fix_run reaches a terminal status (`success`/`failed`/
`rolled_back`) within its declared `timeout_seconds`. Three complementary
mechanisms:

1. `check_run_health()` — called at each `_run_lifecycle` phase boundary
   AND inside RemoteExecutor's SSM polling loop. Raises
   `WatchdogTimeout` if elapsed > `timeout_seconds`, or `RunCancelledError`
   if the operator flipped `agent_runs.cancellation_requested`.

2. `run_deadline()` — helper used by RemoteExecutor to shorten its own
   per-command hard cap to `min(command_cap, run_deadline_remaining)`, so
   a single hanging SSM call can't exceed the run-level budget.

3. `sweep_stale_fix_runs()` — background reaper (run every 60s from main.py
   startup) that force-fails any fix_run whose `started_at + timeout_seconds`
   is in the past AND whose status is still non-terminal. Catches process
   crashes / SIGKILL / OOM where no in-process finalize can run.

Same code path works against public.fix_runs and demo.fix_runs — caller
passes the appropriate supabase client.
